# Photo-Sifter
## Explanation
While taking many photos with my Sony A7iii, I run into the issue of having to go through the lower .jpgs to find each photo I want to edit, then having to search through the folder again to find the respective raw. So I created this to shift through my images folder on my SD card to create a folder and add the files I want to edit.

## Installation
Tested on Windows 10 and macOS Ventura 13.0.1\
Please make sure you have Python3 installed on your system to use this file and have updated it to the most current version (Python 3.10.10).\
Once installed you can move on to usage.

## Usage
### Windows 10
Install the latest release https://github.com/TheRetroGuy2020/Photo-Sifter/releases/latest and run the UI\
If you recieve an error idicating no python is found, please install the python version 3.10 via the Windows Microsoft Store if on Windows\
### macOS
MacOS makes it more difficult for me to run the program due to no dev licence to verify safe application executible, so you are gonna have to do it manually.
On your Mac, open a Finder window, then navigate to the folder you want to use.\
If you donâ€™t see the path bar at the bottom of the Finder window, choose View > Show Path Bar.\
Control-click the folder in the path bar, then do one of the following.\
Open a new window: Choose Open in Terminal.\

If you recieve an error idicating no python is found, make sure you have Homebrew installed on your system, then write the following command:
